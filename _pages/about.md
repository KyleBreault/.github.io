I am a masters student of Biology at The University of Alabama. My primary advisor (Dr. Jon Benstead) is an aquatic ecologist. I also work with Dr. Michael McKain, who studies evolutionary genomics of plants. 

Masters Thesis
======
I study the Pynopysche caddisfly diets. I recieved $12,000 through [CONSERVE](https://conserve-group.org/)

Current Projects
======
Lopez and smith papers, effects of capture and surgery

Professional Experience
======
I have a lot of professional expereince, having worked with rhesus monkeys, fishing boats, endangered atlantic sturgeon, bears, and pest control. These gave me a solid foundation of not only wildlife management, but many things. haha

Career Goals
======
At the complettion of my masters thesis, I wish to seak out a PhD utilizing some skills, especially supercomputing. I can make movement models for animals, combingin the conservation and movement ecology work (sturgeon) that I have done previously, with the skills I got from being at The University of Albama. Upon completion of my PhD, I wish to get involved with scientific outreach. Our science is only as good as our ability to communicate it.
