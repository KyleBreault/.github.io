I am a masters student of Biology at The University of Alabama. My primary advisor (Dr. Jon Benstead) is an aquatic ecologist. I also work with Dr. Michael McKain, who studies evolutionary genomics of plants.

Masters Thesis
======
My research focuses on the food-web dynamics of the shredding caddisfly, Pycnopsyche. Pycnopsyche is an aquatic insect in a feeding regime called ‘shredding insects’ This means Pycnopsyche eats decaying leaves and associated microbes that fall into freshwater ecosystems. Traditionally, understanding what these insects eat involves dissecting their guts and identifying the food items under a microscope. This method often results in low taxonomic resolution, as it is difficult to properly identify food items beyond ‘this is plant tissue’ or ‘this is a fungus.’ This can be problematic for conservation, because as our waterways become drier and more polluted, we need to see how aquatic insect diets change in response to these negative stressors, so that we can make informed conservation decisions. 
To fill this research gap, I will be taking a different approach by using whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS). With WGS, I analyze DNA in the guts of Pycnopsyche and potentially elucidate the exact species of plant and fungus inside their stomachs. The increased taxonomic resolution provided by WGS could influence how stream ecologists and conservations study the feeding habits of shredding and other aquatic insects.

I recieved $12,000 through [CONSERVE](https://conserve-group.org/) and $750 from [Highlands Biological Station](https://highlandsbiological.org/grants-in-aid-of-research/). This financial support has been cruical

Current Projects
======
In addition to my thesis, I have three side projects I am involved in. Lopez and smith papers, effects of capture and surgery

Professional Experience
======
I have a lot of professional expereince, having worked with rhesus monkeys, fishing boats, endangered atlantic sturgeon, bears, and pest control. These gave me a solid foundation of not only wildlife management, but many things. haha

Career Goals
======
At the complettion of my masters thesis, I wish to seak out a PhD utilizing some skills, especially supercomputing. I can make movement models for animals, combingin the conservation and movement ecology work (sturgeon) that I have done previously, with the skills I got from being at The University of Albama. Upon completion of my PhD, I wish to get involved with scientific outreach. Our science is only as good as our ability to communicate it.
