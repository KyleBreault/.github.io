excerpt: 'This paper explores when Atlantic sturgeon enter and leave the Chesapeake Bay. Within the bay, there is high sturgeon mortality due to shipping vessel strikes. Knowing the timing of sturgeon in and out of the bay may help with the conservation of these endangered species.'

Abstract—The Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) has been listed under the Endangered Species Act since 2012, with the Chesapeake Bay distinct 
population segment listed as endangered. We tracked the tim￾ing of occupancy and movement in Chesapeake Bay of adult Atlantic stur￾geon from the York River to 
best iden￾tify when Atlantic sturgeon are likely to interact with anthropogenic threats. We monitored 84 adult (40 male and 44 female) Atlantic sturgeon from 
August 2013 through January 2020 by using acoustic telemetry. Both spawn￾ing and non-spawning fish regularly utilized Chesapeake Bay, with females and males 
arriving as early as 27 Feb￾ruary (when the mean water tempera￾ture was 7.7°C) and 4 March (6.5°C) and departing as late as 24 January (6.3°C) and 27 January 
(6.5°C), respectively. Peak occupation of the bay by Atlan￾tic sturgeon occurred from 1 April to 31 August and again from 15 October to 1 December. Females of 
above average size (>1880 mm in fork length) spent significantly longer in the bay (>113 d) than smaller females and all males before spawning; therefore, the 
females capable of producing the most eggs were disproportionately exposed to anthro￾pogenic threats. Although changes in arrival and departure dates are not 
statistically significant, during the 7 years of this study, both males and females generally arrived earlier and departed later each year than the previous 
year, increasing residency in Chesapeake Bay by a month in that time
