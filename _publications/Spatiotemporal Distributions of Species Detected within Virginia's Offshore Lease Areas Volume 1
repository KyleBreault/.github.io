excerpt: 'This paper explores when Atlantic sturgeon enter and leave the Chesapeake Bay. Within the bay, there is high sturgeon mortality due to shipping vessel strikes. Knowing the timing of sturgeon in and out of the bay may help with the conservation of these endangered species.'

The objective of both research efforts was to provide whatever detection data could be attained through a simple monitoring exercise in order to improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal distributions of tagged species. The goal of this project was to obtain data that will enable resource managers to better understand impacts to marine animals and habitats and formulate relevant mitigation measures especially for those listed on the Endangered Species Act (ESA). This detection data is the only spatiotemporal acoustic data available on species carrying transmitters in these two lease regions and thus, by default, it is the best available data
