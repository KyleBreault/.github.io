I competed and won The 3 Minute Thesis (3mt) competition at The University of Alabama, winning First Place and People's Choice! I qualified for regionals, then regional finals at The Conference of Southern Graduate Schools, beating out X number to get past preliminaries. See the link above to watch the talk!
